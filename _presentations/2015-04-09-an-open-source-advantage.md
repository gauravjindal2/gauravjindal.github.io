A successful app takes a lot of code. The best developers don’t write all of that code themselves; instead they rely on open source to solve all of the common problems. That way they can direct their energy on application-specific tasks.

In this keynote, we’ll show how to use open source effectively. We’ll start with guidance on evaluating a codebase. Then we’ll show you how to grow your relationship with an open source project, from user to contributor to maintainer.

We’ll talk about forking for good and evil, rejected pull requests, and how open source can lead to your code running on one billion Android devices.
