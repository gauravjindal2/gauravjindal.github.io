Retrofit's recently-released version 2 is the easiest way to do HTTP in your applications. Once set up, Retrofit is designed to make declaring endpoints as simple as a method on an interface with annotations. Behind that simplicity, though, there is a lot of power and knowing how to use and configure it can make even the most problematic APIs easy to use.

This talk will focus on configuring three parts of Retrofit:

* Endpoint declarations on interfaces which define how requests are created and sent and how their responses are read and parsed.
* Serialization customization that goes beyond just choosing between JSON or Protocol Buffers.
* Execution mechanisms which enable synchronous or asynchronous requests, integration with third-party libraries, and custom error handling.

Attendees of this talk need no prior Retrofit experience, although the focus will specifically be on configuring and customizing its behavior.
