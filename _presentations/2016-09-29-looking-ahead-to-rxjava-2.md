Development on the next major version of RxJava is underway. While the operators remain largely unchanged, Observable creation, subscription management, and backpressure has been completely overhauled in this new version.

This talk will be an exploration on not only what has changed but also the reasons behind why these changes were made. We'll also talk about how both libraries and applications can migrate to supporting RxJava 2 as well as interop between the two versions.

No prior knowledge of RxJava is strictly required, although concepts, terms, and comparisons will be made that do assume some prior knowledge.
