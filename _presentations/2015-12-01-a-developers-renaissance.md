The development experience for Android is advancing at an unprecedented rate. Things aren't perfect, but compared to one, two, or even five years ago the amount of resources available to developers today is astounding. This talk will feature a look at all of the resources available from Google and others, and how to keep yourself up-to-date with them. Knowing where to find resources is not enough, however. Tips and tricks will be shared for figuring out which ones are appropriate to use so that your application becomes the best that it can be.
