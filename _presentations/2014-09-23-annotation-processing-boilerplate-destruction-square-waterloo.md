The Java programming language has a knack for requiring a lot of boilerplate code. Annotation processing is a feature of the Java compiler which provides hooks that allow automatic code generation based on annotations. This greatly simplifies your code by pushing the burden of the boilerplate on automated tooling.

This talk will briefly cover on showcasing existing annotation processors for Android development. We will then cover how to get started writing your own annotation processor.
