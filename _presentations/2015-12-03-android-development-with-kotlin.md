Using Kotlin for Android development has grown in popularity over the last year. Even to those who are not currently using it, the value proposition of the language immediately resonates. There already are a lot of introductory talks to the language and its extensions for use on Android. This talk will cover advancing the usage and design patterns of the language for Android development to solve larger problems. While the content is targeted at mobile development, there will be value for all Java developers interested in Kotlin.

Prior knowledge or use of Kotlin is not required to attend this talk. Some concepts of the language will be used without introduction but they are intuitive and/or quickly learned. Even if you don't fully understand every language concept on which each example is built, the resulting functionality will be clear.
