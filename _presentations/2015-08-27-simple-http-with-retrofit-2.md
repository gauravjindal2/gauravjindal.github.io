Retrofit has been simplifying HTTP calls for years and this new version is no different. In addition to fixing some long-standing annoyances, there are a handful of new features which make it more powerful than ever.

This talk will focus on how the new APIs in Retrofit aid in making HTTP calls as simple as possible for your app. The integration with OkHttp and Okio APIs will be covered to ensure a full understanding of the HTTP stack. Common use-cases and design patterns through more advanced functionality will end the talk.

No prior Retrofit, OkHttp, or Okio exposure needed. The content may quickly cover or skip some introductory aspects in order to allow focus on more actionable and useful content.
